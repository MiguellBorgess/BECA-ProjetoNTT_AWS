✅ Analysis of the impact of elections on overall retail sales

## 🚧 Missing Features  
These features were not included in the project due to the strict deadline and the knowledge limitations we had at the time of implementation. However, they remain essential for future enhancements:
- **Crawler Creation**: Automating the data catalog.  
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline.  
- **Silver to Gold Transformation**: Refining and enriching datasets for advanced analytics.
